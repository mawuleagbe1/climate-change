                <p>Ghana, located in West Africa along the Gulf of Guinea, experiences a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The country is divided into three main climatic zones:</p>

                        <h3>Coastal Zone</h3>
                        <p>The southern coastal belt has a semi-equatorial climate with two rainy seasons (April-July and September-October) and high humidity. Average temperatures range between 24¬∞C and 30¬∞C.</p>

                        <h3>Forest Zone</h3>
                        <p>The middle belt has a tropical rainforest climate with significant rainfall (1,500-2,000mm annually). This region is crucial for Ghana's cocoa production and biodiversity.</p>

                    <div class="zone-card">

                        <p>The northern savanna experiences a single rainy season (May-September) and is prone to droughts. Temperatures can exceed 40¬∞C during the hot season (March-April).</p>

                <div class="vulnerability-content">
                    <div class="vulnerability-text">
                        <p>Ghana ranks among the countries most vulnerable to climate change due to several factors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Economic dependence on climate-sensitive sectors:</strong> Agriculture contributes about 20% of GDP and employs over 40% of the workforce, particularly in cocoa, which is highly climate-sensitive.</li>
                            <li><strong>High poverty levels:</strong> Approximately 23% of Ghanaians live in poverty, limiting their capacity to adapt to climate impacts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coastal vulnerability:</strong> About 25% of the population lives in coastal areas threatened by sea level rise and coastal erosion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Energy dependence on hydropower:</strong> Hydropower accounts for about 38% of electricity generation, making the energy sector vulnerable to rainfall variability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rapid urbanization:</strong> Urban areas face increasing heat stress and flood risks due to poor drainage and planning.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Economic Dependence on Climate-Sensitive Sectors</h3>
                <p>Nearly 45% of Ghana's workforce is employed in agriculture, fisheries and forestry - sectors highly vulnerable to climate shifts. Our $2 billion cocoa industry, which supplies 20% of global production, faces existential threats as optimal growing regions shift due to rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns.</p>
                
                <h3>Water Stress Challenges</h3>
                <p>Ghana's water resources are under dual pressures from climate change and growing demand. The Akosombo Dam, which provides 35% of our electricity, has seen reduced water levels during recent droughts. Meanwhile, saltwater intrusion is contaminating freshwater aquifers in coastal areas like the Densu Delta.</p>
                
                <h3>Urban Heat Amplification</h3>
                <p>Accra's rapid urbanization has created intense heat islands where temperatures can be 5-7¬∞C higher than surrounding rural areas. The combination of heat-trapping concrete, reduced green spaces, and waste heat from vehicles and industry creates dangerous conditions for vulnerable populations.</p>

                    <h3>Planetary Warming Trends</h3>
                    <p>The Earth's average surface temperature has risen by about 1.1¬∞C since the late 19th century, with the last decade (2011-2020) being the warmest on record. This warming is occurring at a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years. The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters warming by more than 0.6¬∞F (0.33¬∞C) since 1969.</p>
                    <p>In Ghana, this global trend manifests as more frequent and intense heat waves, particularly in northern regions where temperatures now regularly exceed 40¬∞C during the hot season. Nighttime temperatures are also rising, reducing the natural cooling period essential for human health and crop recovery.</p>

                    <h3>Cryosphere Collapse</h3>
                    <p>The Earth's frozen regions are disappearing at alarming rates. Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019, while Antarctica lost about 148 billion tons annually. This ice melt contributes directly to sea level rise, which has accelerated from 1.4 mm per year throughout most of the 20th century to 3.6 mm per year from 2006-2015.</p>
                    <p>While Ghana doesn't have glaciers, these changes affect us through rising sea levels that threaten our coastal communities. The Volta Delta is particularly vulnerable, with projections suggesting up to 1,000 square kilometers could be inundated by 2100 under high emission scenarios.</p>
